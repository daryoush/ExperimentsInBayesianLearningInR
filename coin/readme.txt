Modeling the coin in http://www.behind-the-enemy-lines.com/2008/01/are-you-bayesian-or-frequentist-or.html

I have added the distribution for two head and two tails

TBD:  Add a study where there are multiple possible coins,  Each coin with its own set of data.   Then do the probabality of having two head or
two tails from two different coins.
